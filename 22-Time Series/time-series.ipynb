    "### Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A time-series is a series of data points indexed in time order.  It is naturally one-dimensional, and for our purposes we will consider that all points are equally spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to model time series for either inference (understanding statistical relationships), or for forecasting.  We may select different approaches depending on our interest.  There are two main approaches we will consider here: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regression on time-series data. This is about predicting a time series based on exogenous variables.  \n",
    "2. ARIMA modeling.  This is about predicting a time series as a function of its past values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also combine the two: ARIMA models with exogenous regressors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus today is on the modeling.  Pandas provides some nice data wrangling methods for working with time series data which are documented here: \n",
