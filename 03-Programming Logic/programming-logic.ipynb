    "A Boolean expression is one that can be evaluated by Python and interpreted as being True or False.  You can think of it as making an assertion, and having Python tell you if you are right or not in making that assertion.  It does not pass moral judgments, but will tell you if your assertion is valid or not.  Programming logic is very literal, and Boolean tests are either True or False.    The == operator is an assertion that what is on the left of it is equivalent to what is on its right.  The >= operator is greater than or equal to, and != asserts that two objects are not the same. Don't be confused by the similarity of '=' and '==': one is an assignment of a value to a variable, and the other is a comparison operator.  \n",
