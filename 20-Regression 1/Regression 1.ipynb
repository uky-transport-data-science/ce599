    "# Regression Modeling, Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is adapted from a few sources: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The statsmodels tutorials: http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/\n",
    "- General Assembly's Data Science Course: https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT4 \n",
    "- Urban Informatics and Visualization Course: https://github.com/waddell/urban-informatics-and-visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we learning linear regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "It gives us a way to more formally understand the relationships between variables.  There are a few things in particular we may want to do: \n",
    "\n",
    "- inference: Identify whether the correlations are statistically significant. Of particular interest is the ability to control for confounding factors. \n",
    "- prediction: Change variables and predict the outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical model is assumed to be $Y = X\\beta + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon\\sim N\\left(0,\\sigma^{2}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus here on the simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model that is the most widely used, but makes strong assumptions about the errors being indepentently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).  We won't get much into the theory/mathematics of these models.  There is plenty written about that, and it should have been covered in your stats classes.  Here, we will focus more on how to specify a good model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, there are a few things to keep in mind: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The response variable should be continuous. \n",
    "2. The terms should be linear, but they can include non-linear transformations. \n",
    "3. The residuals (or errors) should be random. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Will be using [Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/).  Start with: \n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install statsmodels\n",
    "    \n",

    "### Today's objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will be looking at wage and salary data to understand the factors that increase or decrease wages.  In particular, we are interested in knowing the effect of getting a degree in civil engineering!  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the PUMS data.  The PUMS (Public-Use Microdata Sample) comes from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS).  Each record represents an individual person, rather than being aggregate tabulations as most Census tables are.  To protect the privacy of respondents, home locations are only known at very aggregate geographies (known as PUMAs).  You can find the data here: \n",
