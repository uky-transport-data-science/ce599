    "# Session 1: Introduction to Course, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python\n",
    "## Course Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is intended to provide students in city and regional planning, and other disciplines with the basic skills to become independently able to write your own code and to leverage open source libraries in Python, data science, and web mapping to do your own data processing, analysis, and mapping.  It is not a traditional GIS course, and relies heavily on free, open source, software.  Why?  Because the explosion of open source tools in the past decade has made it possible for anyone with a willingnes to put in a modest amount of effort to learn how to leverage these tools and build their own, without depending on expensive commercial software.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ove the course of this semester, we plan to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fundamentals of programming with Python\n",
    "* Accessing public data from the web with scraping and APIs (including Twitter, Google, Census data, and the Open Data portals of cities)\n",
    "* Cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing urban data\n",
    "* Visualizing data in Python with charts, graphs, and tables\n",
    "* Developing spatial indicators and mapping urban data with open source desktop and web mapping tools\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is structured as a computer lab based course and each session you will follow along with the lecture and generally also do some experimentation with what we are learning that day.  We will use these Jupyter Notebooks to contain lecture notes and code to demonstrate and to experiment with in class and outside of it.  You should install the software used in the course on a computer of your own to be able to work with it outside of the computer lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "We pace the learning by scheduling 10 approximately weekly exercises, with generally a week to complete them.  These exercises are front-loaded in the semester to build up your skills and confidence.  To gain more independent skills and experience in applying these to problems that are of interest to you, we have an individual semester project assignment.  Individual projects ensure that you learn these skills with enough independence to become self-sufficient and able to continue building your skills on your own.  At the end of the semester we will have a set of lightning talks, which are optional and can be used in place of one exercise."

There are other courses that get into more advanced topic in data science, and we may develop additional courses to go further into urban data science if there is sufficient interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course materials are all online in bcourses, and we will post materials in the files section, specific to each class session.  You will generally begin each class by accessing the materials for that day, downloading them to your computer (either the lab computer or your own laptop), and opening the interactive Jupyter notebook that contains the notes and code for the session.  We will try to incorporate some experimentation into the class sessions, so you can get a better grasp of the material by experimenting with it.\n",

    "This first session will cover the basics of Python, and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data.  The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser, called a Jupyter Notebook.  It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively, with the results appearing inline.  We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now.  Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook.  Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.  "

If you don't know what this is, you'll need to get familiar with the command prompt and navigating around on your computer using change directory commands, in order to be able to launch the notebook. The Lab computers have been upgraded to Windows 10.

On a mac, the syntax is a bit different since it is based on Linux.  Here is a reference for commands on the mac: http://ss64.com/osx/, or a simpler version here: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-basic-unix-commands-to-work-in-terminal.html.

This differs from *low-level* languages like C or C++, in which you generally have to compile code  before you can run it, and if you find errors they have to be diagnosed and then the code re-compiled before you can run it.  Interpreted languages skip the compile step, and just execute code directly, and if there are errors, they are seen at run-time.  "

The convention of using **.py** as the suffix for a Python script makes it easy to find and run such scripts and to have the Python interpreter parse the statements and execute them one at a time, from top to bottom, as though they had been entered interactively (there are some minor differences in how the interpreter parses interactive commands as compared to scripts, but we will ignore that for now).\n",

The convention is to use a # sign at the beginning of the line to indicate that that line is a comment, and not to be parsed and executed by Python.  It does not significantly slow down Python to have to step through comments and ignore them -- so use comments liberally!"
