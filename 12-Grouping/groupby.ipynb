    "Chapter 9 in Python for Data Analysis demonstrates a variety of methods to analyze data via data aggregation and grouping operations. Those are the focus of this session.  Our overall goal for this session is to do Exploratory Data Analysis, which is essentially looking at and probing our data to learn about the patterns we can discover in them.  Often this can generate a better understanding of problems in the data, as well as revealing relationships that might be worth exploring in more depth.\n"
